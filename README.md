## Overview
In simple words, we help you turn your trading strategies into trading bots. This provides a lot of benefits:
1. Remove human emotions from trading, i.e., the bots will strictly follow your trading strategies. 
2. Free up your time, i.e., you do not have sit in front of the compute screen all day long, and let the bots handle the tradings.
3. Fast trading executions, i.e., bots can execute a trade within few milliseconds.
4. Monitoring multiple markets, i.e., the bots can monitor many different markets at the same time

We provide the step by step implementation of some well-known algorithmic trading strategies, e.g., arbitrage, mean reversion, price action strategies, e.t.c. The list will grow over time.

Our goal is to make everyone be able to implement their own trading strategies. Our tutorials are designed in a way that people with no programming background can understand as well.
